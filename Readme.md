#Generators
The Code contains four different type of Generators

Synth-R : Random graph generation with random clusterization

Synth-C : graph generation with 75% clusterization

Synth-HC : graph generation with 95% clusterization

test: graph with 10% connections between clusters

#Execution

test.py -v <vertices> -e <edges> -c <clusters> -f <filename>

test.py -v 100 -e 400 -c 2
